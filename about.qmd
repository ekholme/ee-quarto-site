title: "About Me"
---

I am an educator, researcher, data scientist, and writer. I am currently an Education Data Specialist for Chesterfield County Public Schools, where I use data to help guide decisions and improve students' educational experiences. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, coding, going to the gym, and spending time with friends & family (including my pup, Nala).

I earned my PhD in educational psychology from the [VCU School of Education](https://soe.vcu.edu/) in July 2019, where I worked in the [Motivation in Context Lab](https://rampages.us/motivationincontext/) and in the [Discourse and Learning Lab](https://disclearnlab.squarespace.com/) to study students' motivation, behaviors, and achievement. In my [dissertation](https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/5977/), I studied how writers' daily emotional states (think: anxiety, enjoyment, boredom) influenced their productivity as well as the day-to-day inertia of these emotional states.

During grad school, I discovered a love for working with data -- exploring, visualizing, modeling, and communicating. I mostly work (and blog) in `R`, but I'm also proficient in `Julia`, `Go`, and `SQL` as well. Plus I'm always trying to learn new technologies. Well, as much as I can with a toddler and an infant in the house.

## Projects and Publications

I've published some stuff -- both academic and not -- which you can find on my [publications page](pubs.qmd).


## Consulting and Contracted Work

Time permitting, I occasionally do some consulting and contract work. Although I specialize in education research and data analysis, I'm generally proficient with in statistical modeling, data visualization, dashboard design, and API development, among other things.
