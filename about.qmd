title: "About Me"
---

I am a data scientist, researcher, educator, and writer. I am currently a Data Scientist for Chesterfield County Public Schools, where I use data to help guide decisions and improve students' educational experiences. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, coding, working out, and spending time with friends & family (including my pup, Nala).

I earned my PhD in educational psychology from the [VCU School of Education](https://soe.vcu.edu/) in July 2019, where I worked in the [Motivation in Context Lab](https://rampages.us/motivationincontext/) and in the [Discourse and Learning Lab](https://disclearnlab.squarespace.com/) to study students' motivation, behaviors, and achievement. In my [dissertation](https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/5977/), I studied how writers' daily emotional states (think: anxiety, enjoyment, boredom) influenced their productivity as well as the day-to-day inertia of these emotional states.

## Writing

I write a newsletter called [Edudata](https://edudata.blog) about the intersection of education and data.

I take notes about coding, stats, fitness, and anything else interesting to me at [Brain](https://ekholme.github.io/brain)

You can check out my other publications and talks on my [publications page](pubs.qmd).

## Consulting and Contracted Work

Time permitting, I occasionally do some consulting and contract work. Although I specialize in education research, I'm generally proficient in statistical modeling, data visualization, dashboard design, and API development, among other things. If you're interested in working with me, [send me an email](mailto:eric.ekholm@gmail.com).
